During the winter of 2023 Peter was enrolled in my course on Web Programming. Peter fully engaged in the coursework and produced mastery projects that went well above the expected quality produced by the rest of the class. Peter demonstrated mastery of building UI applications with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and common web frameworks.\nTo support the front-end, Peter built complex back-end REST services powered by a cloud hosted database. This was all served up using their extensive knowledge of HTTP over TLS from servers that Peter managed.\n\n\"The culmination of Peterâ€™s work was a capstone project that represented a full technology stack.\nIn competition with a class of hundreds of students, Peter placed first and earned the coveted Ghirardelli award.\n\n\"I heartily encourage you to give Peter Fullmer full consideration as Peter has not only the technical skills necessary to thrive in your organization, but Peter is easy to work with and would make a great member of any team. Please contact me if you have any questions concerning this recommendation.\""
